# AI-Writing-Assistant
A project I am making to introduce the OpenAPI to my portfolio of tools. I have used it before, but that work isn't on my GitHub, and I can't find it. This writing assistant project might also be useful for me as a tool. Could I call this a SaaS project? Haha.

TO RUN PROJECT:
npm run dev
Dependencies see package.json
